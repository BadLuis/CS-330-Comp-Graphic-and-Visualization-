How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    This project help me to better understand hoiw functions works and how I can call them to draw my object.
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I took the base code provided by the class and build on it. The project was divided and organize by headers files called in the source code.
    this way i draw my cylinders and spheres.
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    A tactic I learn is that we dont have to do everything from scratch, building on what we have can save us time and work.

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Reuse the good code, make it yours and apply it.
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    Big project and assigments cant be donew in one day, for me taking a bit of time every day to read and to code helped me.
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Adding more and more by iteration was a good way to learn how one thing work with the other, It helped me see how everything came together.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    Graphics is something that will keep growing in the industry, gaming and other platforms use a lot of visuals now days, so I think 
    it will help at the end.  One of the thing I was curious was gaming and know a know a 0.1% of how everything start.
